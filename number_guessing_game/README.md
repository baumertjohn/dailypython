# Project Description

Todayâ€™s project is a good opportunity for beginners to put their Python skills to the test since it combines two of the core constructs of Python -conditionals and for-loops.

When the user executes the program, the program prompts the user to guess a number between 1 and 100 in the terminal.

The user types in a number and the program gives feedback on whether that number is too low or too high from the hidden number so the user can adjust the next number:

The user can submit up to 10 numbers until they win or fail.
