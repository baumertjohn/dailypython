# Simple Contact List Manager

## Project Description

Create a program that lets the user submit names and phone numbers through the console and stores those numbers in a text file.

## How the Project Works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a name (e.g., John Smith) and then a phone number (e.g., 0011220011).
2. The program keeps asking the user to enter more names and phone numbers until the user enters “done”.
3. If the user enters “done”, the program creates a new “contacts.txt”* file and saves the data there.
